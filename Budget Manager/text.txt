We need to store data somewhere,
so We are using Chrome APIs for that purpose

We need to add permissions in our manifest for that.

chrome.storage.sync.set/get are used to store data and retrieve data
from the chrome storage
chrome.storage.sync.set({key:value},(e)={optional})
chrome.storage.sync.get("key",(e)=>{})

Additional to UI page, an extension has an option page as well 
It can be accessible via right click
Firstly,
we specify this in our manifest,
"options_page":"options.html"

Now we add notifications to our extension
We set up the permissions for this in the manifest

To create a notification,
we use the chrome API notifications which we send us a notification
chrome.notifications.create("id",notification_object)

notification_object:
{
    type,
    iconUrl,
    title,
    description
}

Event page v/s Background Page:

Background Page are there in background which runs all the
time and use resources, So it it better to stick to event 
pages which are rendered only when required.

Creating a context menu which will be rendered on right click 
at any amount.
It will be an event page

Firstly,
specify it in the manifest
"background":{
    "scripts":[some_script],
    "persistent":false
}
"persistent":false -> Event Page
"persistent":true -> Background Page

Secondly,
Give permissions for Context menu

Now,
In eventPage.js
i) We create a contextItem = {
    id,
    title,
    contexts{When you want this menu to be shown}
}
contexts ex. : selection,click,videoOn,etc

Using chrome API chrome.contextMenus.create(contextItem)
// This will add the Item into the menu

chrome has another API which will look for items clicked On in 
context menu
chrome.contextMenus.onClicked.addListener((e)=>{})

Adding total badge to display the spendings 

chrome has many listener APIs which have a generalized code:
chrome.storage.method/function.addListener((e)=>{})

method/function : Ex. -> onClicked, onChanged, etc.

To set a batch to an extension, we use the API call for badges,
i.e.
chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({"text":something})
